        <h2>Queen</h2>
        <h3>Bohemian Rhapsody</h3>
        <p> Is this the real life? <br>
        Is this just fantasy? <br>
        Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. <br>
        Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. <br>
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, <br>
        Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.<br>
        Anyway the wind blows <br>
        Doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>
