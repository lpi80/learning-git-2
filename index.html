		<h2>Queen</h2>
		<h3>Bohemian Rhapsody</h3>
		<p> 
			Is this the real life? <br>
			Is this just fantasy? <br>
			Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. <br>
			Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. <br>
			I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, <br>
			Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.<br>
			Anyway the wind blows <br>
			Doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Mama just killed a man<br>
			Put a gun against his head <br>
			Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. <br>
			Mama, life had just begun<br>
			But now I've gone and thrown it all away. <br>
			Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry, <br>
			If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, <br>
			Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Too late, my time has come<br>
			Sends shivers down my spine<br>
			Body's aching all the time. <br>
			Good bye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
			Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth. <br>
